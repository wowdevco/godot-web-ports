# The games stay up. I don’t care who you are.
# 🖕 To the Game Owners
If you’ve come here to send a complaint, read this slowly: I genuinely do not give a fuck if you want these taken down. Look, I’m being real with you. I’m not some corporate bot. I’m a person who thinks software should be free and preserved.

The Answer is No: I am not deleting anything.

Your Requests are Trash: Every shitty takedown email I get goes straight into the bin.

Internet Forever: You put it out there; it lives here now. You don't own the internet, and you don't control this repo.

# 🃏 Balatro (HTML5 Port)
Genizy ported Balatro to HTML5 a few months back and took them down. I've had the files. Now, the files are up, they work, and they are staying right here.

To the Balatro Devs: I don't give a flying fuck if you want this taken down.

Send the DMCAs: Go ahead, send your pathetic little takedown requests all fucking day. I’ll be kirking it and laughing at you every time a new one hits my inbox.

Fuck off, bozos. It’s on the web now. Cry about it.

# 🤡 The Purple Moss Collectors "Exposed" Section
These people are the definition of pathetic.

Discord Cowards: They actually went onto Discord and used Inspect Element on my messages to fake screenshots and make me look like a clown.

The Reality: Imagine being so desperate and so shitty at defending your "IP" that you have to fake messages to win an argument. You didn't expose me; you exposed how much of a bunch of losers you actually are.

5 DMCAs: I’ve had five of these from you already. Every single one makes me hate you more. You spend more time being fake on Discord than making your games worth the price tag.

# ⚖️ Hall of Legal Trouble
Some developers think they can bully their way into getting files deleted. They are wrong.

Purple Moss Collectors: Your 5 DMCAs did nothing. I’m still here, and your files are still here.

The Message: Keep wasting your time. I have zero respect for your "legal" threats or your fake-ass screenshots.

# 🗑️ Hall of Shame
Purple Moss Collectors: Absolute fucking clowns. I hate these people with a passion.

Owners of Dungeons & Degenerate Gamblers: Your game is hosted here for free. It’s staying here. Deal with it.

# 🕹️ Why this exists
Because gatekeeping is for losers. This repository is a middle finger to corporate overreach and sensitive developers who can't handle their work being archived.

No Compliance.

No Censorship.

No Takedowns.

# 🛠️ Usage
Grab the files. 2. Play the games.

Mirror this repo. If they try to kill one, ten more should pop up.

I am not your IT guy. If something breaks, fix it yourself. If you have a fix, open a PR.

⚖️ Disclaimer
I don't own this stuff. I just host it because I can. If you’re a lawyer or a dev and you’re mad—stay mad.
